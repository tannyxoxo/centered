        <h1>Episode Nine | Corrupt Capitalism?</h1>
        <p>In this episode, we talk about the pros and cons of capitalism for society as an economic system. The problems with which have become increasingly obvious as economic inequality in the western world continues to get worse. Proponents of the system argue that there is no better alternative, and that the issues we have can be solved. The moderator for this debate is Kelsey R. and the hosts are Mattan B. and Benjamin S.</p>

        <h1>Episode Eight | Extreme Stimulus?</h1>
        <p>This week, we debated the two proposed Coronavirus stimulus packages, the differences between them, and the possible repercussions that it may have. President Biden has made the stimulus bill his top priority for his first few weeks in office, and the debate around it has been heated. The moderator of this debate is Justin X. and the hosts are Alex C. and Kate W.</p>

        <h1>Episode Seven | Additional States?</h1>
        <p>In this debate, we discuss the possible statehood of Washington D.C and Puerto Rico, which would (if admitted) become the 51st and 52nd states. Proponents of the idea say that the residents of these territories are not getting the rights that they should be entitled to, while others argue that it would just expand democratic control of congress and cause further division.

        <h1>Episode Six | Progressive Congress?</h1>
        <p>In this episode, we discuss the democrat's control of the senate, which will allow them to pursue more progressive legislation. However, many argue that this will alienate voters who don't support the progressive ideas. Others say that because democrats won control of the congress and white house, they should be allowed to do the things that they've been promising for so long.

        <h1>Episode Five | Social Censorship</h1>
        <p>In this episode, we debate the issue of social media censorship, or the practice of a social media site flagging, blocking or deleting content it deems to be misinformation or harmful to it's users. This has sparked a lot of controversy in recent years especially now that some politicians are finding their posts under these restrictions. Ben S. is the moderator for this episode, and the hosts for this week are Alex C. and Justin X.</p>

        <h1>Episode Four | Electoral Elimination?</h1>
        <p>In this episode, we discuss the electoral college, which is the system America uses to pick its presidents. We go over how this unique system works, why it was put in place, and whether or not we should continue to use it today. Our goal for this episode was to help eliminate confusion on how the system is supposed to function, and why it was put in place. The moderator for this episode is Alex C, and the hosts for this week are Kelsey R. and Benjamin S.</p>

        <h1>Episode Three | Universal Basic Income?</h1>
        <p>This week, we debate the pros and cons of universal basic income, or UBI, which has been proposed in many countries, and tested around the world. Proponents argue that it could boost the economy and lower poverty, while opponents say that it is unrealistic and far too costly. Because this idea has been supported by both liberals and conservatives, the hosts will only be debating "for" or "against." Hopefully that clears up any confusion on the politics of this topic. The moderator for this weeks episode is Justin X, and the hosts for this week are Kate W. and Ben S.</p>

        <h1>Episode Two | Climate Conundrum</h1>
        <p>The original idea for this episode was to compare more liberal climate response plans, with more conservative ones. But, as we researched the topic of climate change, we came to the realization that there aren't necessarily just two sides, there are dozens of complicated variables. So, this debate ended up covering much more than we originally planned. The speakers for this episode are Alex C. and Justin X, and the moderator is Kelsey R.</p>

        <h1>Episode One | Supreme Predicament</h1>
        On our first episode, we discuss the political debate around the replacement of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Democrats argue that it is overly partisan of the Republicans to allow President Trumps nominee to be appointed during an election year when they did not allow Obama's nominee to be appointed during the 2016 election. While Republicans argue that it is hypocritical of the Democrats to go do the same to them that they did in 2016. The team worked really hard on this first episode, so hopefully you enjoy it. The Speakers for this episode are Kate W, who represents the Democratic view, and Kelsey R. who represents the Republican view.
